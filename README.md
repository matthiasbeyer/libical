# libical

This library aims to be a high-level idomatic Rust crate for ical data handling
and manipulation. It uses the famous
[libical](https://libical.github.io/libical/) via the
[libical-sys](https://github.com/Valodim/libical-sys) crate.


## Status / Progress

* v0.2.0 is a (pending) refactoring effort to make this library more idomatic
  for rust development.
* [v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/libical) was published after the codebase
  was extracted from the [khaleesii](https://github.com/Valodim/khaleesi)
  project.
